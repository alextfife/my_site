<!--start writing here-->
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Legal</h1>
<h1>Affiliates </h1>
<p>I am not affiliated, payed, endorsed, controled, leasing rights to, or in partnership of any kind whatsoever with any person, group, agency, or organization.
 I am not affiliated with any outside group or organization. The <b>only</b> person who control the site is 
 <ul>
	<li>Alex Fife</li>
</ul>
I control the site content, images, and other media as well as the source code used within the site in full.</p>
<h1>Ownership</h1>
<p>I have contributed my talents into this project. In simpler terms, all the code is mine with the exception of widgets, where those are clealy not mine.
All images will be denoted as to respective owners.
Screenshots are mine, however, other images are not, and belog to there respective owners.</p>
<h1>Copyright</h1>
<p>As mentioned previously, I have ownership of the site, which also includes copyright. What is covered by the copyright is the styling and the format the site has. Blogging content will be my original content, covered by copyright.
Also, if I would like to use technology already developed on this site, I can use it and modify it elsewhere.</p>
<h1>Representation</h1>
<p>No, I am not a company. No, I am not a non-profit organization. We do not have to worry about "employee" comments, actions, or thoughts on anything on other media. 
An exception does occur where I could posts something that I regret later. There is a good chance it will be deleted. If I post something offensive or controversial to another user, in the comments, in the page, or by any other media hosted on the server, it will probably be deleted, depending on the topic and situation thereof.</p>
<h1>Finance</h1>
<p>I, nor the server hosting the site, or anyone, gets a profit off of this site. No one or thing gets a profit. Think of it as free information, well, unless you think getting information and insight from me is mental profit, then there you go.</p>
<h1>Controversial Material</h1><a name="controm"></a>
<p>What makes something controversial or offensive? Opposing worldviews. So here's a tip: If you get your feelings hurt, feel free to chat so we may get understanding of each other, and understand this site is controled by me, not you. Otherwise, do not come here.
<b>I do not tolerate <ul><li>Name calling</li><li>Personal Attacks</li><li>Real/possible threats</li></ul> through ANY medium. </b>
If you have issues with the content displayed, such as accuracy or credentials or credability of the content, PLEASE let me know.
 If you are offended by content posts, let me know through any medium POLITELY (having opposing views AND being a jerk doesn't help, buddy). 
 On my site, I endorse any users who bother to visit often to converse with each other politely and exchange ideas.
 Also, try not to use circular logic.
 <br/>
 If you read all the way here, you need an award.
